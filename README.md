# MPC-h1-Manipulation-task
This repository implements a two-layer Model Predictive Control (MPC) system for motion control of the Unitree H1 robotâ€™s arms. The control architecture includes a high-level Trajectory MPC for planning optimal end-effector paths and a low-level Kinematics MPC for computing feasible joint motions. using a reduced 8-DOF arms model
